# LinkedIn Viral Post Skill

I analyzed 40+ posts with 100,000+ impressions

Here's the exact framework that works every time 🚀

## What This Is

**The LinkedIn Viral Post Creation Skill** - a battle-tested framework for creating high-engagement professional content.

Not theory. Not guesswork. Real patterns from real data.

**Credit**: Framework developed by [Allen Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allen-wang/), CEO @ Ditto, proven across 40+ viral posts.

## The Hook (Why You Should Care)

Most LinkedIn posts die in the preview window.

**The problem**: LinkedIn only shows your first 2 lines. If they don't hook, you're invisible.

**The solution**: This skill teaches you the 3 proven hook patterns that force clicks.

**The proof**: 
- 40+ posts using this framework
- 100,000+ total impressions
- Single trending post: 600K+ views
- Consistent 5%+ engagement rates

## What's Inside

| Section | What You Get |
|---------|--------------|
| **5-Step Workflow** | Hook design → Visual selection → Domain insights → Trend riding → Format optimization |
| **3 Hook Templates** | Outcome-first, numbers-first, contrarian - copy-paste ready |
| **Complete Examples** | Startup founder, designer, AI product - see real posts deconstructed |
| **Forbidden Patterns** | 9 failure modes with fixes - avoid what tanks engagement |
| **Success Metrics** | Benchmarks for good/great/viral performance |

## Quick Start

### Installation (OpenCode/Claude Code)

1. Copy `SKILL.md` to your skills directory:
```bash
# OpenCode
cp SKILL.md ~/.config/opencode/skills/linkedin-viral-post.md

# Claude Code (project-specific)
cp SKILL.md .opencode/skill/linkedin-viral-post/SKILL.md
```

2. Invoke when creating LinkedIn content:
```
"Create a LinkedIn post about [your topic]"
"Write viral LinkedIn content for [your expertise]"
```

### The Framework (30-Second Version)

**Step 1: Hook** - First 2 sentences determine everything
```
Pattern: [Past state] → [Current impressive state]
Example: "I dropped out from Berkeley and now I'm CEO of a funded startup"
```

**Step 2: Visual** - Group photos (2-3 people) beat everything

**Step 3: Insight** - Share YOUR domain expertise with numbers
```
Not: "Post consistently"
Yes: "I post 3x/week at 8am PST. Engagement up 40%."
```

**Step 4: Trend** (optional) - Respond to breaking news within 24 hours

**Step 5: Format** - Short paragraphs, clear structure, strong CTA

## Why This Works

**Curiosity gap**: Hook creates knowledge gap brain can't ignore
**Social proof**: Numbers and specifics build credibility
**Actionable**: Readers can apply immediately
**Domain authority**: Authentic expertise, not generic advice

**What this ISN'T**:
- ❌ Humble brags ("Grateful for 10K followers...")
- ❌ Corporate speak ("Excited to announce our synergy...")
- ❌ Generic tips ("Here's 10 ways to be successful...")
- ❌ Stock photos and vague claims

**What this IS**:
- ✅ Real results with numbers
- ✅ Specific frameworks you can copy
- ✅ Authentic domain expertise
- ✅ Actionable insights

## Who This Is For

| You Are | You'll Learn |
|---------|--------------|
| **Startup Founder** | Share metrics, lessons, product insights that attract investors/talent |
| **Designer** | Showcase work, process, case studies that land clients |
| **Engineer** | Technical breakdowns, architecture decisions, code patterns |
| **Product Manager** | Strategy, launches, user insights that build thought leadership |
| **Career Switcher** | Document journey authentically to build network |

**Not for**: Personal updates, casual commentary, corporate announcements (unless you add the framework)

## Examples From The Wild

### Startup Founder (Outcome-First Hook)
```
I dropped out from Berkeley and now I'm CEO of a funded startup

Here's what I learned about building in public:

1. Share the messy middle
Perfection is boring. Posts about struggles get 3x more engagement.
...
```
**Result**: Shows vulnerability + authority. Hook promises transformation story.

### Designer (Numbers-First Hook)
```
I redesigned 12 mobile apps in 2024. 8 are now in the top 100.

Here's the design pattern that worked every time:
...
```
**Result**: Credibility upfront. Specific numbers > vague claims.

### AI Product (Trend-Riding)
```
OpenAI just launched ChatGPT search. Google's worried.

But here's what nobody's talking about:
...
```
**Result**: Timely + contrarian angle. Posted within 24 hours of news.

## The Meta Twist

**This README was written using the skill itself.**

Notice:
- ✅ Hook: "I analyzed 40+ posts..." (numbers-first pattern)
- ✅ Specifics: "100,000+ impressions", "600K+ views"
- ✅ Social proof: Allen Wang attribution
- ✅ Actionable: Copy-paste installation, framework
- ✅ Domain insight: Real patterns from real data

That's the power of the framework. It works for describing itself.

## Advanced: The Algorithm Game

**First 60 minutes matter most.**

LinkedIn algorithm rewards:
- Fast engagement (comments in first hour)
- Meaningful interactions (not just likes)
- Dwell time (people reading, not skimming)

**Your checklist**:
1. Post Tue-Thu, 8-10am local time
2. Respond to EVERY comment in first hour
3. Ask questions that spark discussion
4. Track metrics: impressions, engagement rate, comments

**Iteration cycle**:
- Post → Track 48hrs → Analyze top performer → Reverse-engineer pattern → Apply to next post

## What You Won't Find Here

- Engagement pods or growth hacks
- How to game the algorithm artificially
- Generic "be authentic" advice
- Unproven theories

**Why**: This skill focuses on *content quality*, not manipulation. Great content beats tricks every time.

## Success Metrics (Track These)

| Metric | Good | Great | Viral |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| **Impressions** | 5K+ | 20K+ | 100K+ |
| **Engagement** | 2%+ | 5%+ | 10%+ |
| **Comments** | 10+ | 50+ | 200+ |
| **Shares** | 5+ | 20+ | 100+ |

After 5 posts using this framework, you should see:
- Average impressions up 3-5x
- Engagement rate above 3%
- Consistent comments (not just likes)

If not, diagnose:
1. Is your hook strong enough? (Test with colleagues)
2. Are you sharing domain insights or generic advice?
3. Are you posting at optimal times?
4. Are you engaging in the first hour?
