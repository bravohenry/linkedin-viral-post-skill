# LinkedIn Viral Post Creator

Transform ideas into high-engagement LinkedIn content using data-driven patterns from 40+ posts with 100,000+ impressions.

## Overview

This skill applies battle-tested principles for creating LinkedIn posts that:
- Hook readers in the preview window
- Balance professionalism with humanity
- Share authentic insights from your domain
- Capitalize on trending moments (when relevant)

**Core Philosophy**: LinkedIn favors genuine expertise shared generously, not corporate speak or humble brags.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Craft the Hook (First Two Sentences)

**Why it matters**: LinkedIn preview shows only first 2 lines. These determine click-through.

#### Pattern A: Outcome-First Hook

```markdown
I dropped out from Berkeley and now I'm a billionaire

Here's how I did it without a degree:
```

**Template**:
```
[Past state] → [Current impressive state]

[Promise to reveal the process]:
```

#### Pattern B: Numbers-First Hook

```markdown
I have 40+ LinkedIn posts with 100,000+ impressions

Here's 3 simple steps to instantly make viral posts:
```

**Template**:
```
[Specific achievement with numbers]

Here's [X actionable steps] to [desired outcome]:
```

#### Pattern C: Contrarian Take

```markdown
Everyone's posting AI-generated content. They're tanking their engagement.

I manually write every post. Here's why it works:
```

**Template**:
```
[Common behavior] is wrong. [Consequence].

[Your different approach]. Here's why:
```

**Rules**:
- Lead with concrete outcome or numbers
- Create curiosity gap between state A and state B
- Promise a process, not just a result
- Keep under 30 words total

### Step 2: Choose Visual Elements

**Priority order for images**:

| Image Type | Engagement Impact | When to Use |
|------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Group photo (2-3 people)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Default choice - professional yet human |
| **Before/after comparison** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Showing transformation or results |
| **Product screenshot/demo** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Sharing work or insights |
| **Solo professional headshot** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Personal story or milestone |
| **Meme/humor** | ⭐⭐ | Only if on-brand and relevant |
| **Stock photo** | ⭐ | Avoid - signals generic content |

**Visual Guidelines**:
- Use 2-3 images per post (sweet spot)
- First image should reinforce the hook
- Group photos build trust and credibility
- Screenshots prove expertise (Figma designs, analytics, code)

### Step 3: Share Domain Insights

**Core principle**: Stay in your lane. Share what you uniquely know.

#### Format A: Numbered List

```markdown
3 simple steps to [outcome]:

1. [Principle]: [Brief explanation]

[Optional: Example or data point]

2. [Principle]: [Brief explanation]

[Optional: Example or data point]

3. [Principle]: [Brief explanation]

Bonus:
4. [Advanced technique]
```

#### Format B: Story Arc

```markdown
[Hook with outcome]

The setup:
[Context - where you were]

The challenge:
[Problem you faced]

The breakthrough:
[Key insight or turning point]

The result:
[Specific outcomes with numbers]

What I learned:
[Actionable lesson for reader]
```

#### Format C: Insight Breakdown

```markdown
[Hook with claim]

Here's what most people get wrong:
[Common mistake]

Why it fails:
[Explanation]

What works instead:
[Your approach]

The proof:
[Data or results]
```

**Content Rules**:
- Share **insights**, not common knowledge
- Include **numbers** whenever possible (engagement, growth, metrics)
- Be **specific**: "2-3 group photos" not "use good images"
- Offer **fresh perspective**, not recycled advice
- Reference **your actual work** (designs, products, analysis)

**Domain Examples**:

| Your Domain | Share This |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Robotics** | Latest thoughts on humanoid developments, technical breakdowns |
| **Design** | Figma workflows, design system patterns, case studies |
| **Startups** | Growth metrics, founder lessons, product insights |
| **Engineering** | Architecture decisions, code patterns, performance optimizations |

### Step 4 (Optional): Ride the Trend Wave

**When to use**: A relevant trend is happening RIGHT NOW (within 24-48 hours).

**Trigger conditions**:
- Major industry announcement (CEO stepping down, funding, acquisition)
- Viral product launch related to your space
- Breaking news in your domain
- Cultural moment intersecting with your expertise

**Execution**:
```markdown
[Hook referencing the trend]

Why this matters for [your domain]:
[Your unique angle]

What we're doing differently:
[Connect to your work]

The opportunity:
[Forward-looking insight]
```

**Example** (Allen Wang's approach):
```
When Hinge CEO stepped down to build a product similar to ours:
- Posted 2 quick takes within 24 hours
- Connected trend to Ditto's positioning
- Result: 600K+ views combined
```

**Trend Rules**:
- Speed matters: post within 24 hours
- Find YOUR angle: how does this relate to what you're building?
- Keep it simple: quick takes outperform over-analysis
- Don't force it: if the connection is weak, skip

### Step 5: Format for Readability

**Structure**:
```markdown
[Hook - 2 lines max]

[Main content with clear sections]

[Optional: "Bonus" section for extra insight]

[Call-to-action]
```

**Formatting principles**:
- Short paragraphs (1-3 lines max)
- Blank lines between sections
- Use numbers for steps (1, 2, 3)
- Bold key phrases sparingly
- Avoid emoji spam (1-2 max, or none)

**Call-to-action options**:

| CTA Type | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Engagement** | "Comment below or DM me for [topic] questions 🚀" |
| **Follow** | "Follow along for more [domain] insights" |
| **Resource** | "Want the full template? Link in comments." |
| **Conversation** | "What's your experience with [topic]? Let me know below." |

## Complete Examples

### Example 1: Outcome-First Hook (Startup Founder)

```markdown
I dropped out from Berkeley and now I'm CEO of a funded startup

Here's what I learned about building in public:

1. Share the messy middle

Perfection is boring. Posts about struggles get 3x more engagement than wins.
Example: Our first product demo crashed. That post hit 50K views.

2. Help your competitors

Counter-intuitive but true. I share our metrics openly. Builds trust, attracts talent.

3. Document, don't create

You're already doing the work. Just narrate it.
Our investor updates → LinkedIn posts → 100K impressions/month

Bonus:
4. Respond to every comment in the first hour
LinkedIn algorithm rewards fast engagement. Set a timer.

Comment: What's stopping you from sharing your journey?
```

### Example 2: Numbers-First Hook (Designer)

```markdown
I redesigned 12 mobile apps in 2024. 8 are now in the top 100.

Here's the design pattern that worked every time:

The mistake:
Most apps hide their core value behind onboarding screens.
Users bounce in 10 seconds.

The fix:
Show, don't tell.

Instead of: "Welcome! We help you track fitness."
Do this: Open directly to the tracking screen with demo data.

The proof:
App retention increased 40% after removing our 3-screen onboarding.
Just one screen with "Skip tour" button instead.

Here's the Figma breakdown:
[Screenshot of before/after designs]

What I learned:
Users want to experience value, not read about it.
Onboarding should be invisible, not mandatory.

DM me if you want the full case study 👋
```

### Example 3: Trend-Riding (AI Product)

```markdown
OpenAI just launched ChatGPT search. Google's worried.

But here's what nobody's talking about:

Search isn't the product. Trust is.

Why this matters:
- ChatGPT hallucinates 15% of the time (Stanford study)
- Google has 25 years of credibility
- Users forgive Google's ads, but won't forgive AI's lies

The real battle:
Who builds better fact-checking infrastructure faster?

What we're doing:
At [YourProduct], we're embedding source citations in every AI response.
Not as an afterthought. As the core feature.

Early results:
- Users verify sources 60% of the time
- Trust score: 4.2/5 vs industry avg 2.8/5

The opportunity:
Transparent AI beats black-box AI.
Even if it's slower.

## Forbidden Patterns

| Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Generic hook** | "Excited to share..." | Lead with outcome or numbers |
| **Wall of text** | No paragraph breaks | Max 3 lines per paragraph |
| **Humble brag** | "Grateful for 10K followers" | Share actionable insight instead |
| **Corporate speak** | "Synergy", "thought leadership" | Write like you talk |
| **Vague advice** | "Post consistently" | Be specific: "Post 3x/week at 8am PST" |
| **Stock photos** | Generic business images | Use real photos of you/your work |
| **No CTA** | Post ends abruptly | Ask question or invite DMs |
| **Emoji overload** | "🚀💯🔥💪✨" | Use 0-2 max |
| **Recycled content** | Same advice everyone shares | Share YOUR unique experience |

## Anti-Patterns (Content to Avoid)

```markdown
❌ "Thrilled to announce..."
✅ "We just hit $1M ARR. Here's the strategy:"

❌ "10 tips for success"
✅ "I failed 10 times before this worked. Here's what changed:"

❌ [Generic stock photo of handshake]
✅ [Your actual team working, product screenshot, or event photo]

❌ "Thoughts on AI?"
✅ "I analyzed 500 AI startups. 3 patterns predict success:"

❌ "Check out our new feature!"
✅ "Our users asked for X. We built it in 2 weeks. Here's the technical breakdown:"
```

## Success Metrics

Track these to improve:

| Metric | Good | Great | Viral |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| **Impressions** | 5K+ | 20K+ | 100K+ |
| **Engagement rate** | 2%+ | 5%+ | 10%+ |
| **Comments** | 10+ | 50+ | 200+ |
| **Shares** | 5+ | 20+ | 100+ |

**What to analyze**:
- Which hooks get highest click-through?
- Which topics drive most engagement?
- What posting time works for your audience?
- Which CTAs get most responses?

**Iteration cycle**:
1. Post → track metrics in 48 hours
2. Identify top performer
3. Reverse-engineer what worked
4. Apply pattern to next post
5. A/B test variations

## Rules

1. **Hook is everything**: First 2 sentences determine success
2. **Stay in your lane**: Share your domain expertise
3. **Numbers build credibility**: Specific metrics beat vague claims
4. **Group photos win**: 2-3 people, professional context
5. **Format for skimmers**: Short paragraphs, clear structure
6. **Speed beats perfection**: For trends, post within 24 hours
7. **Engage immediately**: Respond to comments in first hour
8. **Be genuinely helpful**: Share insights, not self-promotion

## When NOT to Use This Skill

- Personal/private updates (job changes, life events) - be authentic, not formulaic
- Commenting on others' posts - be conversational
- Company announcements - follow brand guidelines
- Controversial topics - tread carefully, this is a professional platform
- You have nothing new to say - don't post for the sake of posting
